# Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)

![](/public/thankyou.png)

This easy to use patient questionnaire is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the nine DSM-IV criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). It has been validated for use in primary care.

Validity has been assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview. PHQ-9 score â‰¥10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression.

```
Depression Severity: 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe.
